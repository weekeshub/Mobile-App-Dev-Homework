Simple Math Game - Mobile Application



Brief Description:
- This application is a game in which the user is presented with two-digit subtraction questions.
- The user attempts to guess the correct answer to increase their score in the game. 
- If they are successful, their score increases. If they are unsuccessful, their score decreases.
- The application has a reset feature, allowing the user to reset the score to 0/0 and generate a new subtraction equation.
- The score is counted as "Number correct/Number of total attempts (questions)". Ex- "Score: 6/8" means "6 correct answers out of 8 total attempted questions"
