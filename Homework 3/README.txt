Rate Your Favorite Animal - Mobile Application

Brief Description:

- This app contains two different Activities.
- This app utilizes the Shared Preferences functionalities of Android Studio by storing the data for the ratings assigned to each of the animals. 
- This data is preserved between application sessions. If the user closes the app, the data will be preserved and displayed when the user reopens the app.
- The first activity allows the user to choose which one of the four animals they would like to rate. The second one allows the user to assign a rating to the chosen animal.
- The first activity utilizes image buttons to choose one of the animals. Upon clicking one, the user is taken to the second activity to assign a rating.
- Upon clicking the "Save Rating" button in the second activity, the rating data for each animal will be saved via Shared Preferences for use across activites.
